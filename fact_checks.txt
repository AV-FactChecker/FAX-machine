Well do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about this whole idea.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'The statement contains inaccuracies and misleading information. While President Bidens student loan forgiveness plans have faced legal challenges and were blocked by courts, it is not accurate to say that loans were terminated or that the Supreme Court rejected the plan multiple times. The situation is more complex and involves ongoing legal battles.'}

I didnt discuss it with JD in all fairness. JD, and I dont mind.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'The statement is a mix of fragmented and unclear claims, making it difficult to fact-check accurately. Additionally, Kamala Harriss running mate is not JD Vance; her running mate was Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election. JD Vance is a Republican senator from Ohio, not affiliated with Kamala Harris.'}
{'statement': 'They couldnt get student loans. They didnt even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people. and a lot of other people that had loans, they can never get this approved.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'The statement is misleading and inaccurate. Student loans have been widely available for decades, and many people have successfully obtained them to fund their education. The claim that "they couldnt get student loans" or "didnt even come close to getting student loans" is not true. The ongoing legal battles are about loan forgiveness, not the availability of student loans.'}
{'statement': 'They wanted to get it out of Congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldnt be done and now you have a vote of the people on abortion.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'The statement refers to the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, which effectively removed federal protections for abortion rights and allowed individual states to set their own laws regarding abortion. This has led to various state-level votes and legislation on the issue. Therefore, the claim that the issue was moved out of federal control and is now subject to state decisions is accurate.'}
{'statement': 'understand what has been happening under Donald Trumps abortion bans. who pray and dream of having a family. are being denied IVF treatments.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There were no federal abortion bans implemented under Donald Trumps administration. However, there were various state-level restrictions on abortion that could have been influenced by his administrations policies. The claim that people are being denied IVF treatments specifically due to these restrictions is not substantiated by evidence. IVF treatment regulations vary by state and are generally separate from abortion laws.'}
{'statement': 'who can barely afford child care as it is have to travel to state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it. And what you are putting her through is unconscionable.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, several states enacted strict abortion laws, which have forced some women to travel out of state to obtain abortion services. This can be financially burdensome and logistically challenging, especially for those who already struggle to afford child care and other expenses. The statement accurately reflects the difficulties faced by individuals seeking abortions under these circumstances.'}
{'statement': 'People of America have not, the majority of Americans believe in a womans right to make a difference. decisions about her own body and that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot in red and blue states both. The people of America have voted for freedom.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'Polling data consistently shows that a majority of Americans support the right to abortion in some form. Additionally, in several states, including traditionally conservative (red) states, ballot measures related to protecting abortion rights have passed, indicating public support for reproductive freedom. Therefore, the statement is accurate.'}
{'statement': 'I have been a leader on fertilization IVF.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There is no substantial evidence or record to support the claim that Donald Trump has been a leader on in vitro fertilization (IVF). While his administration did make some policy decisions related to healthcare, there is no specific indication that he has been notably involved or recognized as a leader in the field of IVF.'}
{'statement': 'You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month. And probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'Abortions in the third trimester (seventh, eighth, and ninth months) are extremely rare and typically only performed when the life or health of the mother is at serious risk or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. The claim about "probably after birth" is misleading and false; infanticide is illegal in the United States. The reference to the former governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, is also taken out of context. Northam was discussing cases of non-viable pregnancies or severe fetal abnormalities, not advocating for infanticide.'}
{'statement': 'We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden administration. President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'It is accurate that illegal border crossings reached record highs during the Biden administration. In response, the administration implemented new asylum restrictions and other measures to manage the situation. Following these changes, there has been a reported decrease in the number of illegal border crossings.'}
{'statement': 'why did the administration wait until months before the election to act. And would you have done anything differently from President Biden?', 'result': False, 'reason': 'The statement implies that the Biden administration only acted on border security and asylum restrictions months before an election, which is not accurate. The Biden administration has been addressing immigration issues throughout its tenure, implementing various policies and measures over time. The timing of specific actions does not necessarily correlate with election cycles.'}
{'statement': 'The United States Senate came up with a border security bill which I support. it. And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the board to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job. it would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming in. to the United States.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'There have been multiple border security bills proposed in the U.S. Senate, some of which included provisions for increasing the number of border agents and addressing drug smuggling issues, including fentanyl. The statement aligns with typical legislative efforts to enhance border security and support law enforcement.'}
{'statement': 'Donald Trump got on the phone called up some folks in Congress and said kill the bill and you know why? Because hed prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There is no verifiable evidence or public record to support the claim that Donald Trump personally intervened by calling members of Congress to kill a specific border security bill. While it is possible for political figures to influence legislative processes behind the scenes, this specific allegation lacks concrete proof.'}

A lot of towns dont want to talk about it because theyre so embarrassed by it.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'While it is true that the U.S. has experienced significant immigration, the claim that towns are "so embarrassed" by the situation that they do not want to talk about it is subjective and lacks concrete evidence. Furthermore, the statement implies a uniformly negative impact on towns across the U.S., which is an oversimplification. The effects of immigration can vary widely depending on local contexts and perspectives.'}
{'statement': 'in Springfield, theyre eating the dogs, the people that came in. the cats, theyre eating, theyre eating the pets of the people. that live there. And this is whats happening in our country, and its a shame.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There is no credible evidence or verified reports to support the claim that immigrants in Springfield are eating the pets of local residents. This statement is highly inflammatory and lacks any factual basis. It appears to be an attempt to incite fear and xenophobia.'}
{'statement': 'You bring up Springfield, Ohio, and ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. he told us there had been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'ABC News did reach out to the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, who confirmed that there had been no credible reports of pets being harmed or injured by immigrants. This aligns with the factual situation as verified by news sources.'}
{'statement': 'Springfield City Manager says theres no evidence of that.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'The Springfield City Manager has indeed stated that there is no evidence to support claims of pets being harmed or eaten by immigrants. This statement aligns with the verified information provided by local authorities and reported by news outlets.'}

Many Republicans who have worked with past Republican presidents such as George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain have also expressed support for the Biden-Harris administration.'}

General Kelly has indeed expressed severe disapproval of Trump�s actions and characterized him as dangerous and unfit for office.'}

This assertion is not backed by any credible data or reports. Immigration policies and enforcement mechanisms do not support the notion that foreign governments are deliberately offloading criminals into the U.S.'}

Crime here is up and through the roof. despite their fraudulent statements that they made, crime in this country is through the roof. and we have a new form of crime, its called migrant crime, and its happening at levels that nobody thought possible.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'Recent reports, such as those from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, indicate that overall violent crime in the U.S. has decreased, including a significant drop in homicides.

Crime data is typically compiled from a wide range of cities and jurisdictions. Additionally, the claim about the creation of 818,000 jobs being fraudulent lacks supporting evidence. Job creation numbers are usually verified through multiple independent sources, including government agencies and economic research institutions.'}

Additionally, there is no record of such a statement being made the day after being arraigned on felony counts. This appears to be a mischaracterization or fabrication.'}
{'statement': 'every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There is no evidence to support the claim that every legal case against Donald Trump was initiated by political opponents. Legal proceedings are typically based on investigations conducted by law enforcement agencies and prosecutors who are expected to operate independently of political influence. This statement lacks verifiable proof and is likely an overgeneralization.'}
{'statement': 'and Im winning most of them and I will win the rest on appeal. And you saw that with the decision that came. down just recently from the Supreme Court.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There is no evidence to support the claim that Donald Trump is winning most of his legal cases or that a recent Supreme Court decision has been in his favor regarding these cases. Legal outcomes are determined on a case-by-case basis, and many of the cases involving Trump are ongoing or have resulted in unfavorable rulings for him. The statement appears to be an exaggeration without factual backing.'}

As of now, there have been no legal proceedings or findings against Joe Biden regarding a documents case. This statement is misleading and not based on verified facts.'}
{'statement': 'The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'There has been no recent ruling by the United States Supreme Court declaring that a former president would be essentially immune from any misconduct.

{'statement': 'in your last run for president, you said you wanted to ban fracking. now you dont. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons, now youre campaign says you dont. You supported decriminalizing border crossings.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'During her 2020 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris did express support for banning fracking, implementing mandatory buyback programs for assault weapons, and decriminalizing border crossings. However, her positions on these issues have evolved over time, and she has moderated some of her stances since then.'}
{'statement': 'I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'During her 2020 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris did express support for banning fracking. This statement contradicts her past position on the issue.'}
{'statement': 'Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes provisions that open new leases for oil and gas drilling, including fracking. This was part of a compromise to gain support for the broader climate and energy initiatives within the bill.'}
{'statement': 'we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase the cost of living. Increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'It is unlikely that Kamala Harris would advocate for increasing the cost of living as a policy goal. The statement appears to be a miscommunication or error. Increasing the number of homes by 3 million is a more plausible objective to address housing shortages.'}
{'statement': 'My values have not changed.', 'result': True, 'reason': 'Kamala Harris stating that her values have not changed is a subjective statement about her personal beliefs and integrity. Without evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to accept her assertion about her own values.'}
{'statement': 'I wasnt given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn-Belarusian. the Brooklyn Queens and a great father and I learned a lot from him but I was given a fraction of that.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'Donald Trump has claimed various amounts regarding the inheritance from his father. According to a New York Times investigation, Donald Trump received at least $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father over the years through various financial maneuvers. This contradicts his claim of receiving only a fraction of $400 million.'}
{'statement': 'Shes been against it for 12 years. Defund the police. Shes been against it for 12 years.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'Kamala Harris has not been advocating for defunding the police for 12 years. In fact, her record as a prosecutor and Attorney General of California shows support for law enforcement. The "defund the police" movement gained prominence in 2020, and Harris has expressed support for police reform rather than defunding.'}
{'statement': 'she was big on defund the police. In Minnesota, she went out... and wanted to let criminals that killed people that burned down Minneapolis.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'Kamala Harris has not been a proponent of defunding the police.

There is also no evidence supporting claims that she wants to mandate transgender operations for undocumented immigrants in prison or confiscate guns. Regarding fracking, while her stance has evolved, she has stated she does not intend to ban fracking outright.'}
{'statement': 'I got the oil business going like... Nobody has ever done before. They took, when they took over, they got rid of it. of getting rid of it and the prices were going up the roof.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'While Donald Trump did implement policies favorable to the oil industry, such as deregulation and opening up more land for drilling, it is an exaggeration to say "nobody has ever done before." The oil industry has been a significant part of U.S. policy for decades. Additionally, the claim that the subsequent administration "got rid of it" and caused prices to go "up the roof" oversimplifies complex market dynamics influenced by global factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic.'}

Well go back to windmills and well go back to... solar where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'This statement is an exaggeration and not based on factual evidence. While a shift towards renewable energy sources like wind and solar is part of many political agendas, it is unrealistic to claim that fossil fuels would be completely eliminated immediately after an election. Transitioning energy sources is a gradual process and involves complex economic and infrastructural considerations.'}
{'statement': 'solar plant, by the way Im a big fan of solar, but they take 400,000 solar plants, 500 acres of desert soil. These are not good things for the environment.', 'result': False, 'reason': 'The statement contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. Solar plants do require land, but the claim that 400,000 solar plants each take 500 acres of desert soil is not accurate. Additionally, while large-scale solar installations do have environmental impacts, they are generally considered more environmentally friendly compared to fossil fuels due to their lower greenhouse gas emissions.'}

He also said he would be with them, although he did not go to the Capitol himself. The events at the Capitol were widely broadcast, showing officers under attack.

Donald Trump did not end the Nord Stream 2 pipeline; construction continued during his presidency and was nearly complete when Joe Biden took office. Biden did not 'put it back on day one'; his administration waived sanctions on the company overseeing the project later on. The Keystone XL pipeline permit was revoked by Biden on his first day in office, but it is unrelated to Nord Stream 2.
